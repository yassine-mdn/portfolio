Hey, I'm **Yassine Mouddene**, and I'm a **Software Engineer** who loves building things that work seamlessly and efficiently. Whether it’s crafting high-performance backend systems or designing smooth user experiences, I’m always eager to dive into complex problems and find elegant solutions.

Specialized in working with <React /><Angular /><Typescript/><Spring /><Java /><Django /><Python /> 

I’ve built everything from real-time monitoring tools to **machine learning** powered analytics. But beyond code, I enjoy the challenge of learning new things and pushing my skills forward.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me **hiking** in the mountains, deep into **reading** a book, listening to **music**, or just playing video games.
